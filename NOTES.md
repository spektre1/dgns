# Demon Girl Next Door - Notes

Does this make more sense as a visual novel, or as an RPG? I particularly like the idea of focusing on slice of life/farm simulator sort of games, with some puzzles. That is potentially interesting enough to keep my attention. More game systems/ more world means larger scope of course, so I'm trying not to get ahead of myself, but building out the environments is the thing I'll personally have the most fun with. That said, from what you're writing, maybe it makes more sense as a visual novel?

I asked about Tarot because I'm considering using them either thematically or for RNG for game systems. Just a thought at the moment, as I don't have a particular system in mind for it yet.

I talked to some teenage girls (daughters of some friends of mine) a couple days ago, and asked them what sorts of things about magic and witches they thought were fun and could be good for games, and a repeat idea was having a familiar, and brewing potions in cauldrons. Some sort of crafting system for potions could be fun. Cat familiars obvs, but also fun things like ravens, or bound imps could also be interesting, etc.

Possible game systems that could be interesting; I kind of like the idea of a forest just outside town that's got a lot of plants and random stuff that you can collect. Foraging seems like a good mechanic for this sort of low-key exploratory/creative play style.

Plant magic. Different types of plants require different sorts of resources to grow effectively. Was also considering ley lines as part of a puzzle system of sorts, can extend this a few ways. I think collecting the plant wild from the forest (or having it gifted by an NPC) and then cultivating it is interesting. Can turn into relatively complex game systems if we do potions/crafting.

Demons typically, particularly this cursed type we're discussing, usually have contracts of some form binding them. What's the curse/contract look like? Could have quantitative factors that act sort of like "collect 1,000,000 of whatever to be released from your contract" if we want to be particularly gamey. Could be a late-game completionist thing too.

I have the impression that the game needs some sort of relationship system.
Maybe it's just state based and you complete particular quests to advance the
primary relationship.

Demons are typically invisible to mortals, unless you're like a holy type that can smell the sulfur on you. Perhaps Lyra takes to wearing a hat (witch hat!) to hide the horns?
(I did this with a tiefling character in a D&D game lol) An obvious story beat to me is eventually Lyra is proud enough of who she is, has accepted it, that she doesn't need to hide the horns any more.

Thoughts? I'll probably start in with some concept art for things and see if that helps me fill in some design holes. I often get ideas about what needs to be in a place once I try to draw it and the people in it.

What sort of, well, abilities do demons have that cause the mortals fear them?

## Locations

Consider: If it's a one-time use location, treating it more like a visual novel is a good idea to reduce asset creation. If they're repeated locales, we should make them complete game world areas that can be explored. Story should try to take advantage of locations and re-use them if possible.
